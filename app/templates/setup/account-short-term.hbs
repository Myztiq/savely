  <div class="radio">
    <label>
      {{radio-button value='directDeposit' checked=shortTermLocation}}
      Help me set up direct deposit so Dream Forward can transfer the right amount of money from my paycheck to my existing outside account where I’m already saving.

  <div class="radio">
    <label>
      {{radio-button value='personal' checked=shortTermLocation}}
      Just keep it in my personal saving map, but don’t deduct from my paycheck for it. I’ll handle it.
